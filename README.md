# WordPress-ACF-Flexible-Content-Builder
This is a snippet code used to create dynamic content with Advanced Custom Field's flexible content field in WordPress.  To use this, include this file in your function.php. Set install the ACF plugin and create a flexible content field called `content_rows` (or whatever you choose, the name must correspond to lines 6 & 7).  Inside that flexible field, create a number of sub-fields of your choosing.  Then, in the flexible-content-builder.php file, add case statements starting on line 10 for each flexible content sub field.  The name of the sub field must match the case statement.  Do whatever logic you need and add the HTML for the content block.

On the page you wish to display the content, you may use `the_content()` or `the_flexible_content()` to display the content.  This snippet will save the rendered HTML to the content section of the page, however, WordPress's content filter has presented issues in the past with HTML.  The HTML is saved in the content area for searching purposes.
